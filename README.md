#MediTrain AI Patient Persona Generator
Welcome to the MediTrain AI Patient Persona Generator! This project is a Flask-based web application that generates detailed patient personas and provides AI-powered answers to user queries. It leverages the GPT-2 language model to simulate realistic conversations and assist medical training or patient interaction scenarios.

#Features

Patient Persona Generation: Input a medical condition, age range, and gender to generate a personalized patient profile.
AI-Powered Q&A: Ask questions about the generated persona and receive realistic, GPT-2-generated responses.
Responsive Web UI: User-friendly and mobile-responsive interface for smooth interaction.
REST API: Built with Flask for scalable and flexible backend integration.

#Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
AI Model: GPT-2 via Hugging Face Transformers
Database: JSON-based dataset for condition-specific conversations
Styling: Custom CSS for a responsive and modern design
Deployment: Gunicorn (for production server)
